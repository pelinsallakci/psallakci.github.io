        // Order placement:
        // Properties:
        // holds information about items.
        // there are options that reduces transit times and delivery costs.
        // holds information about the shipping address and receipent.

        // Sends information about the order details to an order management system.
        // automatically determining the appropriate location to ship from.
        // one order with multiple items can be taken from several locations.
        // Packing:
        // Properties:
        // the packing process proceeds protectively.
        // prioritizes the boxes to be easily handled.
        // includes delivery instructions.
        // Behaviors:
        // packs items into appropriate shipping boxes.
        // weighs the packages.
        // labels the packages with recipients' addresses.
        // Shipping:
        // Properties:
        // Includes two alternatives:being shipped directly to customer or consolidated
        // with other orders going to nearby locations.
        // Has a relaible tracking system.
        // Has a option to cut costs and minimze the total number of shipments.
        // Behaviors:
        // Transporting orders to their final destination.
        // Following up with the customers to ensure satisfaction.
        // Answering questions regarding the product purchased.
